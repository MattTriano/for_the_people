## What does the govt do for us?

As a resident of the US, the news regularly reminds me that the US government has a significant budget deficit and a 13-figure national debt, but I can't recall the news ever trying to explore the question "what are we getting in exchange for this debt, and is it worth it?". I suspect that's because the US government delivers a massive catalog of services and each service would take a fair amount of time to describe (let alone research), and any specific service probably isn't interesting to the majority of Americans, thus discouraging for-profit news orgs from paying the opportunity-cost. Still, it's vitally important that this information is accessible to the public, as our system for making decisions (i.e. representative democracy) cannot produce good decisions if the voting public cannot access accurate and relevant information.

I suspect ample funding is a prerequisite for significant impact, so I'm going to start my exploration by looking at the US federal budget.
